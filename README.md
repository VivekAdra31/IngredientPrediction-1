# IngredientPrediction

This is a project for the course CE1015 - Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

The goal of the project is to recommend groceries based on pictures of items currently present in a buyer's basket. For this we have created a recommendor system using scikit-learn and implemented Google's Vision API for the ingredient recognition. More details can be found in the PDF.

The data for this project can be found [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking/data)
